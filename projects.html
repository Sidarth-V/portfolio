            During the pandemic, all of us underwent serious lifestyle changes.
            We realized that a major problem in our lives has been the growth of
            things to work on with limited pathways to vent or stress.
            Anxiet-ease was made to help all those students, employees, parents
            and any other group who have had their work increased over the
            pandemic leading to further stress on their lives.

              Enigma 8.0 is an online cryptic hunt organized by the IEEE-VIT
              Student Chapter. This initiative is completely developed and led
              by students and is played by thousands of competitors from all
              over the world. This being the 8th edition of Enigma, we remain
              undefeated as no one has ever been able to complete our challenge!
